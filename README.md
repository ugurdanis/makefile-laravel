## Getting Started

Ensure that your environment has the following dependencies installed:

- **PHP**
- **Composer**
- **Node.js and npm**

To use the Makefile, you must have `make` installed. On Unix-based systems, `make` is usually pre-installed. For Windows, you may need to install a compatible version of `make`.

## Commands Overview

### Setup Commands

These commands help set up your Laravel project by installing dependencies and configuring initial settings.

- `make install` - Install dependencies (Composer and npm) and set up the database.
- `make serve` - Start the development server.
- `make migrate` - Run database migrations.
- `make seed` - Run the database seeder.
- `make fresh` - Refresh all migrations and seed the database.
- `make dev` - Run npm in development mode.
- `make build` - Run npm in production mode.

### Development Commands

These commands are used to clear caches, optimize configurations, and run tests.

- `make clear` - Clear all application caches (config, route, view).
- `make optimize` - Cache and optimize configuration and routes.
- `make test` - Run PHPUnit tests.
